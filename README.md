# temperature-evolution
Study of the average temperature in Spain (by years and by months) and also by different countries in the eurozone between the years 1800 and 2013. 

Implementation of three different Machine Learning models to predict the average temperature by years in Spain between the same period as before. The models are compared with the residual mean squared error (RMSE). The best model we have found it is the Random forest using 500 trees with a RMSE of 0.184Â°C.
