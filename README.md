# temperature-evolution
Study of the average temperature in Spain (by years and by months) and also by different countries in the eurozone between the years 1800 and 2013. 

Implementation of three different Machine Learning methods to predict the temperature by years in Spain between the same period as before. The methods are compared with the residual mean squared error. The better method we have found it is the Random forest using 500 trees.
